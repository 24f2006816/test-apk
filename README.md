# Theme Toggle Application

This is a simple, single-page web application demonstrating a robust and functional dark/light theme toggle. It is built using HTML, vanilla JavaScript, and styled with Tailwind CSS, addressing and fixing previous issues with toggle button functionality.

## Features

*   **Reliable Theme Toggle**: Seamlessly switch between dark and light modes with a click of a button. The toggle logic has been refined for perfect operation.
*   **Persistence**: Your preferred theme setting is saved in local storage, ensuring it persists across browser sessions and page reloads.
*   **System Preference Integration**: On first visit, the application intelligently detects and applies your system's preferred theme (light or dark mode).
*   **Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC) Prevention**: The theme is applied instantly upon page load, minimizing visual flickering.
*   **Responsive Design**: The application's layout is fully responsive, adapting gracefully to various screen sizes.
*   **Single File Deployment**: All code (HTML, CSS via Tailwind CDN, and JavaScript) is contained within a single `index.html` file for ultimate simplicity and ease of deployment.

## Getting Started

To run this application, simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser. No special setup, build process, or server is required.

## Usage

1.  Open `index.html` in your browser.
2.  Observe the initial theme, which will be set based on your system preference or your last saved setting.
3.  Locate the theme toggle button (represented by a moon or sun icon) in the top-right corner of the content area.
4.  Click the icon to instantly switch between dark and light modes. The icon will also update to reflect the current theme.
5.  Close and reopen the page; you'll notice your last chosen theme is automatically re-applied.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5**: Provides the structural foundation of the web page.
*   **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for efficient and rapid UI development, ensuring a responsive and modern design.
*   **Vanilla JavaScript**: Powers the theme toggle logic, local storage management, and dynamic icon updates.
