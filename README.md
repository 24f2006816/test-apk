# 🌓 Theme Toggle App

This is a simple, single-page web application demonstrating how to implement a dark mode/light mode toggle feature using vanilla JavaScript and Tailwind CSS.

## ✨ Features

- **Theme Toggle**: Seamlessly switch between light and dark modes.
- **Persistence**: Your chosen theme preference is saved in `localStorage` and will persist across browser sessions.
- **System Preference Detection**: Automatically applies dark mode if the user's operating system prefers it on the first visit.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various screen sizes using Tailwind CSS utilities.
- **Modern UI**: Clean and minimal interface styled with Tailwind CSS.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the semantic structure of the web page.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development and responsive design.
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**: For handling the theme toggle logic and `localStorage` interactions.

## 🛠️ Setup and Usage

This application is a single HTML file, making it incredibly easy to set up and run.

1.  **Save the file**: Save the `index.html` content to a file named `index.html` on your local machine.
2.  **Open in browser**: Double-click the `index.html` file, or open it with your preferred web browser.

That's it! You can now interact with the theme toggle button.
